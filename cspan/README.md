Scoring for CSPAN tasks used by Engle labs
==========================================
_Email me for much more maintainable ways of pulling out the complex span data._


These tasks produce a lot of output.  This script attempts to produce commonly used metrics of performance, such as total recalled correctly, etc..

Out:

* a file with one row per subject
* a long file with one row per trial (per subject)

Columns:

* TimeLim -- maximum time allowed for operation
* err_Acc
* err_Math
* err_Speed
* meanMathRT1
* meanMath2


...actually, see script for details on what columns mean.
